				<p class="text-center">The mission of Off Broadway's Junior and Senior Dance Company is to provide a performance experience for higher level dancers to enhance their dance and performing skill levels.</p><br />
				<p class="text-center">As a Company member, dancers compete in local and travel dance competitions; further their appreciation of dance; dance with professional instructors both in and out of the studio; and get an more thorough appreciation and knowledge of the field of dance.</p><br />
				<p class="text-center">Our primary dance genres of focus are Lyrical, Modern and Broadway Jazz. Solo, Duet and Trio competitive opportunities are available.</p><br />
				<p class="text-center">We are a “performance” company first and foremost. Our goal is performing – not competing. When Company attends a competition, it is for the experience in which that environment can provide. Our ultimate goal is to increase the dancer’s self esteem and performing skills.</p><br />
