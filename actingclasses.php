				<h4 class="text-center">OBD offers a wide variety of camps, classes and workshops for all children ages 3 to 18.</h4>
				<p class="text-center">Most OBD classes typically culminate with a sharing for friends and family on stage at OBD, and most of our teachers are actors themselves!</p>
				<p class="text-center">Our programs focus on the process of playbuilding, and we believe that, through theatre, every child can become more comfortable and confident with their  voices, bodies and ideas as well as be better able to work as a part of a great ensemble.</p>
				<p class="text-center">Also, it's really FUN!</p>
