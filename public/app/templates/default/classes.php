We will attack stage basics, auditions, building a character that conveys a story through song and working as an ensemble to bring those moments to life.  We will cover selections from Annie, Peter Pan, Seussical, Honk and many more to help keep the class fresh and challenging. We will have periodic showcases through the year to showcase their growth and passion.</p>

We will create spontaneous scenes with unique characters that are humorous and memorable. We challenge the young performer to use their imagination, think outside the box and help establish the who -what- where- when and why of the scene. We will touch on the terminology of stage, work on scenes from plays and understand text of what the playwright is trying to convey. They will grow in confidence and have a greater understanding of themselves and connect with the other performers in the class.We will have periodic showcases through the year to showcase their growth and passion.</p>
