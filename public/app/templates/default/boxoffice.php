      <h4 class="text-center"><strong>Seating Policies</strong></h4>
      <p class="text-center">Step inside and expect the unexpected! Most seating is general admission with the exception of a limited number of VIP seats (See Ticket Prices). Our box office and lobby are open 45 minutes prior to show time. Doors to the theatre typically open 20 minutes prior to show time. Doors may open a few minutes earlier should the lobby become very full. Late comers or those who show up after the theatre doors open may not be able to get seating together so do plan on arriving early. Well-behaved children are encouraged to sit on the carpeted floor down front – this really gives them a unique theatre experience! Ticket Exchanges Tickets may be exchanged for another performance of the same title up to 24 hours prior to the performance you are scheduled to attend. All exchanges are subject to availability and exchange fees. There are no refunds.</p>

Public group prices start at just $8, and special rates are available for senior and educational groups (including Scout Troops). Call 770-664-2410 for information and reservations</p>
