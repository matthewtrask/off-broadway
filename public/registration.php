				<p class="text-center"><b>Class Attendance</b></p>
				<p class="text-center">Consistent attendance at classes is extremely important for all performers. Please arrive on time for all classes, dressed in appropriate dance attire and ready to begin class warm-up exercises. Warm-up is a necessary part of dance classes that helps dancers prevent injury. Students should be dropped off for class 10 or 15 minutes before class time. Please call if a student will be absent or very late for class.
									   <br /><br />Parents of Pre-school and Kindergarten children are asked to be sure to have their child visit the restroom before class begins so there are no interruptions in class time. It is the responsibility of parents of young children to pick up their children immediately after class, as we cannot be responsible for unattended children in the studios. A late charge will take effect if a child is left waiting longer than 15 minutes after class.</p>
				<p class="text-center"><b>Class Time Observation</b></p>
				<p class="text-center">In order to maintain the attention of the students, discipline during class and to avoid interruptions in the teaching atmosphere, parents, siblings and observers are not allowed in the classrooms at any time unless specifically invited for a particular reason. Classroom doors are not to be opened during class times. For observation purposes,look thru windows in the lobby.</p>
				<p class="text-center"><b>Studio Etiquette</b></p>
				<p class="text-center">We request and expect students and parents to be respectful to instructors, other students and other parents. Please refrain from profanity, negative attitudes, harmful behavior, hurtful gossip and disrespect in any form in our studios. Anyone engaging in such conduct may be asked to leave. While students, parents, siblings and observers are welcome in the lobby, we ask that there be no running, shouting or disruptive behavior in the lobby or elsewhere in any of the classrooms, changing rooms or hallways. Children not taking classes must not be left alone without adult supervision. Eating is allowed on the tables provided in the lobby but please clean up after yourself before leaving. Only water bottles are allowed in the classroom studios—no food, sodas or gum.<br /><br />In the interest of safety, do not park at curbside for pickup and drop off — have your child wait until someone comes in the studio to pick them up.</p>
				<p class="text-center"><b>Studio Closings</b></p>
				<p class="text-center">Closed days for inclement weather and holidays will coincide with Fulton County School closings, however on teacher workdays our studios will be open. In addition, when Halloween falls on a class day, our studios will be closed.</p>
