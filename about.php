				<h2 class="text-center">About Off Broadway Dance Studio</h2>
				<p class="text-center">Off Broadway Performing Arts and the Off Broadway Children’s Theatre were established in 1999, based on a lifelong passion for theater and a love for teaching young people to find their self worth and confidence. Christian and Shannon Mayer followed this dream, and have watched Off Broadway grow into a successful company that has worked with hundreds of young performers for many years.  We believe every child can shine if given the chance and confidence to do so.</div>

					<p class="text-center">Since 2000, Off Broadway has welcomed hundreds of students that have taken dance classes at our school in Alpharetta, GA. We started out very small, but have become the fast growing performing arts school in the area!</p>
					<p class="text-center">We offer dance classes in ballet, jazz, tap, hip hop, preschool dance classes and other dance styles, a full children’s theatre and private music lessons. We have a year end recital that is broken up over 3 shows we are able to make the shows a comfortable length for parents, grandparents and young children.</p>
					<p class="text-center">All studios are not the same. As a parent, we realize you have a choice between several different dance schools, which is why we try to update and improve our facilities. In addition, we provide ongoing training to our staff to ensure we are always providing our students and parents with the best experience possible.</p>
					<p class="text-center">Call us today or drop by and you will see why more families trust us for dance, theatre and music each year more than any other studio.</p>
