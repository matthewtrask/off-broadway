            <h4>Why Choose Off Broadway Children's Theatre</h4>
            <p>Back in 2000, Chris and Shannon Mayer had a desire to open up a performing arts center that was 
                focused on celebrating the unique personalities of kids. We envisioned a place where kids felt 
                confident and could be themselves and share their love for the arts. We wanted to create an environment 
                that was so irresistable, kids could not imagine being any place else. With an array of classes in 
                Musical Theatre, Acting and dance classes that support our theatre curriculum, we help kids ages 
                4-18 discover their passion for the performing arts.</p>
